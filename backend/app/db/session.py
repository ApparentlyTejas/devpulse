"""Async session factory + FastAPI dependency.

One `async_sessionmaker` is built per engine. Each HTTP request gets its
own `AsyncSession` via the `get_db_session` dependency. That dependency
encapsulates the begin / commit / rollback / close lifecycle, so route
handlers and services never have to think about it.

Idiomatic SQLAlchemy 2.0 async pattern.
